1. Why use Frameworks
    a. deal with complexity
        a. organize different parts of the codebase
    b. find relevant code quickly
    c. update functionality without a rewrite of large portions of the codebase
    d. code reuse
    e. ease of testing
    
2. Why does code get complex
    a. hard to read code    
        -bad or inconsistent coding style
        -hard to read variable and function names
        -no comments or api documentation
    b. high cohesion
        -when smaller pieces of functionality are strongly related to each other 
         within some code boundary
        -how well does that one thing stick to doing just one thing
    c. loose coupling
        -least possible dependency of one component on another component
        -if you change one you don't have to change the other
        
        
Examination of "Low Cohesion and Tight Coupling Code"

1. tight coupling between the input field and keyUp function  
  -how do you have event listening without tight coupling?
2. calculateNumericOutput has two things that it does (low cohesion)
  -calculates the number
  -displays it to the screen
